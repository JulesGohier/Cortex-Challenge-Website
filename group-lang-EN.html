                        The organization of our group is what made it efficient throughout the project. Thus, an important point is that even before the assignment of topics, we had already prepared a GitHub repository to host the project and outlined the different strategies for using git, depending on the types of possible projects. Moreover, we had agreed on the time for each part of the project: the algorithm development phase would last 4 weeks (including the week of vacation); the optimization phase one week, together with the website mockup phase (one/week) and the beginning of the website development which would last about ten days.                    </p>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        When the theme of the Cortex Challenge was assigned to us, we immediately proceeded to divide the tasks; a minimum of algorithms had to be established per challenge: we then agreed that each of us would develop one algorithm per challenge. Only then did we come up with different algorithms for each challenge and select the most relevant ones to develop.                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Then came the next step: we decided that Calliste would perform the optimizations on all the algorithms (after each of the other's algorithms had been examined) while Jules would build a model for the website. To perform the most relevant optimizations possible, we both developed different test cards per difficulty and plotted the average execution time results in an Excel table. This was done in order to compare the algorithms for each challenge, to make our choice of algorithm for the competition and for Calliste to build the program for it.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, the optimizations finished and the model completed with a site already well advanced, it would only remain to write the content of the pages for the site and the documentation.                    </p>
